Deprecated! The functionality of joker is now built-in to Jtool2 when used with --analyze on any kernelcache

This is basically used to analyze iOS Kernels. It aids in iOS / macOS Kernel Reverse Engineering, but it is legacy software. Most of its functionality is now part of jtool2. Just in case you need it, however, it is here.
