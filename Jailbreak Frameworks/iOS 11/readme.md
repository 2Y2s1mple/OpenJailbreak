The QiLin toolkit was initially released for iOS 11 by Jonathan Levin, and then ported to iOS 12. Using it on iOS 11 would work, assuming a proper tfp0 exploit for iOS 11 is used. However, the remount technique is different. While you can use QiLin's built-in remount for iOS 11, on iOS 12 with the introduction of APFS snapshots, the remount from QiLin is totally broken (was supposed to get a fix at the time as Jonathan told me, but that never happened unfortunately). That was back in 2019 - chances it will ever be fixed are slim since QiLin is closed source and J has lost interest in it for now.

So, if you are building an iOS 11 up to iOS 12 jailbreak using this, for iOS 11 use the built-in QiLin remount, while for iOS 12 you need a separate one like the one used in Unc0ver.
