Johnny's (semi) open source license, v0.4
-----------------------------------------

This is (well, will be, at the time of writing) open source, and I can't but appeal to your sense of decency. 
You might try compile this and try to pass it as your own. Heck, you might even try to run it through llvm-obfuscator. 
But that would be stealing code. And obfuscate as you will, you can't obfuscate enough to hide the methods. 
So, primum non nocere. Do no harm, and do not steal.

To be fully clear:

 - Yes, you may use this source or code library as you see fit, PROVIDED THAT:

	- IT IS NOT USED COMMERCIALLY IN ANY WAY. For this, I ask that you contact my company, @Technologeeks, 
		and ask for proper licensing - they'll also provide official support.

	- IT IS NOT USED AS A COMPONENT OF AN APT IN ANY KIND FORM OR MANNER. 
		(NSO/Hackin9/Finfisher/Equus/etc - that means you)

	- WHEN YOU DO USE IT, I ASK THAT YOU MENTION THAT YOUR TOOL IS "powered by the QiLin Toolkit", 
          or otherwise provide a user facing indication that it is using this code. 
	   I'd appreciate it if you tweeted with #QiLin, too.

	- If you spread lies about other people, propaganda or false claims, while using this toolkit, 
then you must renounce your ways, and apologize. Then you can use it freely.

  - There are no limitation on nationality, specific people exclusions (i.e. this is AISE, subject to last condition, above ;-), 
or any other race, color or creed - provided the above are met.


  - QiLin comes with NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER. YOU USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

    I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE OR YOUR DATA OR OTHERWISE, 

    WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT RESULT TO YOUR IOS DEVICE BY USING THIS. 
 
  - Remember I'm doing this AS A FAVOR. I AM NO IN WAY INDEBTED OR COMMITTED TO SUPPORT THIS, OR ANY OTHER OF MY TOOLS.
    You don't have to thank for this (you're welcome) but please don't slander me either.

  - Should you wish to contribute/donate, you may do so in one of the following ways:

	- Monetary: Pick a charity. Any charity. Of your choice. Pay them however money you want. 
		    Optionally, tweet/fb/insta/snap-whatever a screen capture stating "#QiLin". 

        - Development: Through http://NewOSXBook.com/forum - you are welcome to ask (proper technical, not lame wen eta) 
			questions and engage in discussions
	


First, do no harm. Next, have fun :-)

Changelog:

- v0.1 Was AISE but SE is being more of an ass than usual and slandering fake claims directly attacking me. 
So this was updated with new condition excluding him until he grows up and behaves like the decent, 
talented researcher he can be.

- v0.3 adds request to tweet #QiLin. 

- v0.4 states what should be obvious - NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER
